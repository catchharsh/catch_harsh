_**Z Algorithm**_

>Problem Motivation
 - Given a pattern string and a main string, find all the occurences of pattern in main string in O(n).
 - In the basic approach, it is basically a O(n^2) approach available, but the question demands a O(n) complexity algorithm.

>Algorithm (in basic words)
 - Given a string S of length n, the Z Algorithm produces an array Z where Z[i] is the length of the longest substring starting from S[i] which is also a prefix of S, i.e. the maximum k such that S[j] = S[i + j] for all 0 ≤ j < k. Note that Z[i] = 0 means that S[0] ≠ S[i]. For easier terminology, we will refer to substrings which are also a prefix as prefix-substrings.

>Algorithm Description
 - While traversing the string we maintain two variables L and R such that S[L...R] is a prefix substring.
 - Initially, we run brutly for finding Z[1], by comparing and traversing S[0..] with S[1...].Thus, it will give the starting L and R.
 - Now, let's say that for i , we have all values till Z[i-1] and L and R currently, in order to calculate Z[i] from L to R , two cases will arise  
   - If _i>R_, it means that no prefix substring is there, thus brutly finding the answer for Z[i] and we will update L to R in this case like comparing S[i...] to S[0...].
   - Otherwise, _i<R_ , then lets say _k=i-l_, thus _Z[i] = min(Z[k], R-i+1)_ because S[i..] matches with S[k...] for atleast _R-i+1_ elements , Now consider: 
     - If _Z[k] < R-i+1_ , there is no longer substring from _i_ or Z[k] would be greater, thus in this case _Z[i]=Z[k]_.
     - If _Z[k] >= R-i+1_ thus may be more characters than _R-i+1_ can be matched, that we have to find, thus in this case again find Z[i] by brute forcing and update L and R again.

>Time Complexity 
  - The run time complexity is clearly O(n), because we never compare the characters less than R , thus R can reach n atmost in _n_ steps incrementing 1 each time, thus complexity is O(n).

>Problem Solution
  - One application of the Z Algorithm is for the standard string matching problem of finding matches for a pattern T of length m in a string S of length n. We can do this in O(n + m) time by using the Z Algorithm on the string T Φ S (that is, concatenating T, Φ, and S) where Φ is a character that matches nothing. The indices i with Z[i] = m correspond to matches of T in S.

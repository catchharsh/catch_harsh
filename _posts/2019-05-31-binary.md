**Binary Search**


>Here is my way of implementing the Binary search    
>Necessary Conditons:  
>  
>1. Answer must be in the sample space, if not known 0 to Long long int may be preferred  
>2. Yes / No should be followed...  
>3. Monotonicity.  

## The pseudo code  
>Binary Search Approach  
<pre>
int lo,hi;  
int mid=lo+(hi-lo)/2;  
while(lo<=hi)  
{  
	check the condition;  
	if()  
	ans=mid;hi=mid-1; // The condition which contains answer, in that make ans=mid  
	else  
	lo=mid+1;  
}  
cout<<ans;  
</pre>

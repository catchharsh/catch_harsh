 - **SOLVED** [_Lift Hopping_](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&page=show_problem&problem=1742). It was an interseting qstn on implementing Djikstra , this qstn inlvolves rather graph making skills  
 First you can make each floor assessible differently by elevators by making floor counting from 1-500.  
 Then run simply djikstra, on graph, it would be easier, check out some corner cases :)

   And instead of subtracting coin values, add coin values to largest sum possible from bigger end.
